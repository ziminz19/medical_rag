While text embeddings are typically learned in the Euclidean space , directional similarity is often more effective in tasks such as word similarity and document clustering , which creates a gap between the training stage and usage stage of text embedding . To close this gap , we propose a spherical generative model based on which unsupervised word and paragraph embeddings are jointly learned . To learn text embeddings in the spherical space , we develop an efﬁcient optimization algorithm with convergence guarantee based on Riemannian optimization . Our model enjoys high efﬁciency and achieves state - of - the - art performances on various text embedding tasks including word similarity and document clustering2 . Introduction Recent years have witnessed enormous success of unsupervised text embedding techniques [ 29 , 30 , 33 ] in various natural language processing and text mining tasks . Such techniques capture the semantics of textual units ( e.g. , words , paragraphs ) via learning low - dimensional distributed representations in an unsupervised way , which can be either directly used as feature representations or further ﬁne - tuned with training data from downstream supervised tasks . Notably , the popular Word2Vec method [ 29 , 30 ] learns word embeddings in the Euclidean space , by modeling local word co - occurrences in the corpus . This strategy has later been extended to obtain embeddings of other textual units such as sentences [ 2 , 19 ] and paragraphs [ 22 ] . Despite the success of unsupervised text embedding techniques , an intriguing gap exists between the training procedure and the practical usages of the learned embeddings . While the embeddings are learned in the Euclidean space , it is often the directional similarity between word vectors that captures word semantics more effectively . Across a wide range of word similarity and document clustering tasks [ 3 , 16 , 23 ] , it is common practice to either use cosine similarity as the similarity metric or ﬁrst normalize word and document vectors before computing textual similarities . Current procedures of training text embeddings in the Euclidean space and using their similarities in the spherical space is clearly suboptimal . After projecting the embedding from Euclidean space to spherical space , the optimal solution to the loss function in the original space may not remain optimal in the new space .

CL ] 4 Nov 2019 \n of a unit sphere : A word is ﬁrst generated according to the semantics of the paragraph , and then the surrounding words are generated in consistency with the center word ’s semantics . We cast the learning of the generative model as an optimization problem and propose an efﬁcient Riemannian optimization procedure to learn spherical text embeddings . Another major advantage of our spherical text embedding model is that it can jointly learn word embeddings and paragraph embeddings . This property naturally stems from our two - step generative process , where the generation of a word is dependent on its belonging paragraph with a von Mishes- Fisher distribution in the spherical space . Explicitly modeling the generative relationships between words and their belonging paragraphs allows paragraph embeddings to be directly obtained during the training stage . Furthermore , it allows the model to learn better word embeddings by jointly exploiting word - word and word - paragraph co - occurrence statistics ; this is distinct from existing word embedding techniques that learn word embeddings only based on word co - occurrences [ 5 , 29 , 30 , 33 ] in the corpus . Contributions . ( 1 ) We propose to learn text embeddings in the spherical space which addresses the mismatch issue between training and using embeddings of previous Euclidean embedding models ; ( 2 ) We propose a two - step generative model that jointly learns unsupervised word and paragraph embeddings by exploiting word - word and word - paragraph co - occurrence statistics ; ( 3 ) We develop an efﬁcient optimization algorithm in the spherical space with convergence guarantee ; ( 4 ) Our model achieves state - of - the - art performances on various text embedding applications .

The embeddings are trained to capture semantic similarity of textual units based on co - occurrence statistics , and demonstrate effectiveness on various text semantics tasks such as named entity recognition [ 21 ] , text classiﬁcation [ 18 , 27 , 28 , 38 ] and machine translation [ 8 ] . Recently , non - Euclidean embedding space has been explored for learning speciﬁc structural representations . Poincaré [ 11 , 31 , 39 ] , Lorentz [ 32 ] and hyperbolic cone [ 15 ] models have proven successful on learning hierarchical representations in a hyperbolic space for tasks such as lexical entailment and link prediction . Our model also learns unsupervised text embeddings in a non - Euclidean space , but still for general text embedding applications including word similarity and document clustering . 2.2 Spherical Space Models Previous works have shown that the spherical space is a superior choice for tasks focusing on directional similarity . For example , normalizing document tf - idf vectors is common practice when used as features for document clustering and classiﬁcation , which helps regularize the vector against the document length and leads to better document clustering performance [ 3 , 16 ] . Spherical generative modeling [ 4 , 43 , 44 ] models the distribution of words on the unit sphere , motivated by the effectiveness of directional metrics over word embeddings . Recently , spherical models also show great effectiveness in deep learning . Spherical normalization [ 24 ] on the input leads to easier optimization , faster convergence and better accuracy of neural networks . Also , a spherical loss function can be used to replace the conventional softmax layer in language generation tasks , which results in faster and better generation quality [ 20 ] . Motivated by the success of these models , we propose to learn unsupervised text embeddings in the spherical space so that the embedding space discrepancy between training and usage can be eliminated , and directional similarity is more effectively captured . Spherical Text Embedding In this section , we introduce the spherical generative model for jointly learning word and paragraph embeddings and the corresponding loss function . \n 3.1 The Generative Model The design of our generative model is inspired by the way humans write articles : Each word should be semantically consistent with not only its surrounding words , but also the entire paragraph / document . Speciﬁcally , we assume text generation is a two - step process : A center word is ﬁrst generated according to the semantics of the paragraph , and then the surrounding words are generated based on the center word ’s semantics3 . Further , we assume the direction in the spherical embedding space captures textual semantics , and higher directional similarity implies higher co - occurrence probability . Hence , we model the text generation"

    "text": "paragraph , and then the surrounding words are generated based on the center word ’s semantics3 . Further , we assume the direction in the spherical embedding space captures textual semantics , and higher directional similarity implies higher co - occurrence probability . Hence , we model the text generation process as follows : Given a paragraph d , a center word u is ﬁrst generated by p(u | d ) ∝exp(cos(u , d ) ) , ( 1 ) and then a context word is generated by p(v | u ) ∝exp(cos(v , u ) ) , ( 2 ) where ∥u∥= ∥v∥= ∥d∥= 1 , and cos ( · , · ) denotes the cosine of the angle between two vectors on the unit sphere . Next we derive the analytic forms of Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . Theorem 1 . When the corpus has inﬁnite vocabulary , i.e. , |V | →∞ , the analytic forms of Equa- tions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are given by the von Mises - Fisher ( vMF ) distribution with the prior embedding as the mean direction and constant 1 as the concentration parameter , i.e. , lim |V |→∞p(v | u ) = vMFp(v ; u , 1 ) , lim |V |→∞p(u | d ) = vMFp(u ; d , 1 ) . The proof of Theorem 1 can be found in Appendix A. The vMF distribution deﬁnes a probability density over a hypersphere and is parameterized by a mean vector µ and a concentration parameter κ . The probability density closer to µ is greater and the spread is controlled by κ . Formally , A unit random vector x ∈Sp−1 has the p - variate vMF distribution vMFp(x ; µ , κ ) if its probability dense function is f(x ; µ , κ ) = cp(κ ) exp ( κ · cos(x , µ ) ) , where ∥µ∥= 1 is the mean direction , κ ≥0 is the concentration parameter , and the normalization constant cp(κ ) is given by cp(κ ) = κp/2−1 ( 2π)p/2Ip/2−1(κ ) , where Ir ( · ) represents the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind at order r , given by Deﬁnition 1 in the appendix . Finally , the probability density function of a context word v appearing in a center word u ’s local context window in a paragraph / document d is given by p(v , u | d ) ∝p(v | u ) · p(u | d ) ∝vMFp(v ; u , 1 ) · vMFp(u ; d , 1 ) . 3.2 Objective Given a positive training tuple ( u , v , d ) where v appears in the local context window of u in paragraph d , we aim to maximize the probability p(v , u | d ) , while minimize the probability p(v , u′ | d ) where u′ is a"

This is similar to the negative sampling technique used in Word2Vec [ 30 ] and GloVe [ 33 ] . To achieve this , we employ a max - margin loss function , similar to [ 15 , 40 , 41 ] , and push the log likelihood of the positive tuple over the negative one by a margin : L(u , v , d ) = max \u0012 0 , m −log \u0000cp(1 ) exp(cos(v , u ) ) · cp(1 ) exp(cos(u , d ) ) \u0001 + log \u0000cp(1 ) exp(cos(v , u′ ) ) · cp(1 ) exp(cos(u′ , d ) ) \u0001\u0013 = max ( 0 , m −cos(v , u ) −cos(u , d ) + cos(v , u′ ) + cos(u′ , d ) ) , ( 3 ) 3Like previous works , we assume each word has independent center word representation and context word representation , and thus the generation processes of a word as a center word and as a context word are independent . \n where m > 0 is the margin . Optimization In this section , we describe the approach to optimize the objective introduced in the previous section on the unit sphere . 4.1 The Constrained Optimization Problem The unit hypersphere Sp−1 : = { x ∈Rp | ∥x∥= 1 } is the common choice for spherical space optimization problems . The text embedding training is thus a constrained optimization problem : min Θ L(Θ ) s.t . ∀θ ∈Θ : ∥θ∥= 1 , where Θ = { ui } |V | i=1 ∪{vi } |V | i=1 ∪{di } |D| i=1 is the set of target word embeddings , context word embeddings and paragraph embeddings to be learned . Since the optimization problem is constrained on the unit sphere , the Euclidean space optimization methods such as SGD can not be used to optimize our objective , because the Euclidean gradient provides the update direction in a non - curvature space , while the parameters in our model must be updated on a surface with constant positive curvature . Therefore , we need to base our embedding training problem on Riemannian optimization . 4.2 Preliminaries A Riemannian manifold ( M , g ) is a real , smooth manifold whose tangent spaces are endowed with a smoothly varying inner product g , also called the Riemannian metric . Let TxM denote the tangent space at x ∈M , then g deﬁnes the inner product ⟨ · , · ⟩x : TxM × TxM →R. A unit sphere Sp−1 can be considered as a Riemmannian"

A unit sphere Sp−1 can be considered as a Riemmannian submanifold of Rp , and its Riemannian metric can be inherited from Rp , i.e. , ⟨α , β⟩x : = α⊤β . The intrinsic distance on the unit sphere between two arbitrary points x , y ∈Sp−1 is deﬁned by d(x , y ) : = arccos(x⊤y ) . A geodesic segment γ : [ a , b ] →Sp−1 is the generalization of a straight line to the sphere , and it is said to be minimal if it equals to the intrinsic distance between its end points , i.e. , ℓ(γ ) = arccos(γ(a)⊤γ(b ) ) . Let TxSp−1 denote the tangent hyperplane at x ∈Sp−1 , i.e. , TxSp−1 : = { y ∈Rp | x⊤y = 0 } . The projection onto TxSp−1 is given by the linear mapping I −xx⊤ : Rp →TxSp−1 where I is the identity matrix . The exponential mapping expx : TxSp−1 →Sp−1 projects a tangent vector z ∈TxSp−1 onto the sphere such that expx(z ) = y , γ(0 ) = x , γ(1 ) = y and ∂ ∂tγ(0 ) = z. 4.3 Riemannian Optimization Since the unit sphere is a Riemannian manifold , we can optimize our objectives with Riemannian SGD [ 6 , 34 ] . Speciﬁcally , the parameters are updated by xt+1 = expxt ( −ηtgrad f(xt ) ) , where ηt denotes the learning rate and grad f(xt ) ∈TxtSp−1 is the Riemannian gradient of a differentiable function f : Sp−1 →R. On the unit sphere , the exponential mapping expx : TxSp−1 →Sp−1 is given by expx(z ) : = ( cos(∥z∥)x + sin(∥z∥ ) z ∥z∥ , z ∈TxSp−1\\{0 } , x , z = 0 . ( 4 ) To derive the Riemannian gradient grad f(x ) at x , we view Sp−1 as a Riemannian submanifold of Rp endowed with the canonical Riemannian metric ⟨α , β⟩x : = α⊤β . Then the Riemannian gradient is obtained by using the linear mapping I −xx⊤ : Rp →TxSp−1 to project the Euclidean gradient ∇f(x ) from the ambient Euclidean space onto the tangent hyperplane [ 1 , 12 ] , i.e. , grad f(x ) : = \u0000I −xx⊤\u0001 ∇f(x ) .

We propose to multiply z with the cosine distance between xt and −∇f(xt ) as the modiﬁed Riemannian gradient so that angular distances are taken into account during the parameter update . 4.4 Training Details We describe two sets of design that lead to more efﬁcient and effective training of the above optimiza- tion procedure . First , the exponential mapping requires computation of non - linear functions , speciﬁcally , sin ( · ) and cos ( · ) in Equation ( 4 ) , which is inefﬁcient especially when the corpus is large . To tackle this issue , we can use a ﬁrst - order approximation of the exponential mapping , called a retraction , i.e. , Rx ( z ) : TxSp−1 →Sp−1 such that d(Rx ( z ) , expx(z ) ) = O(∥z∥2 ) . For the unit sphere , we can simply deﬁne the retraction Rx ( z ) to be an addition in the ambient Euclidean space followed by a projection onto the sphere [ 1 , 6 ] , i.e. , Rx ( z ) : = x + z ∥x + z∥. ( 6 ) Second , the Riemannian gradient given by Equation ( 5 ) provides the correct direction to update the parameters on the sphere , but its norm is not optimal when our goal is to train embeddings that capture directional similarity . This issue can be illustrated by the following toy example shown in Figure 1 : Consider a point xt with Euclidean coordinate ( 0 , 1 ) on a 2 - d unit sphere S1 and two Euclidean gradient descent directions −∇f1(xt ) = [ 1 , 1]⊤and −∇f2(xt ) = [ 1 , −1]⊤. Also , for simplicity , assume ηt = 1 . In this case , the Riemannian gradient projected from −∇f2(xt ) is the same with that of −∇f1(xt ) and is equal to [ 1 , 0]⊤ , i.e. , grad f1(xt ) = grad f2(xt ) = [ 1 , 0]⊤. However , when our goal is to capture directional information and distance is measured by the angles between vectors , −∇f2(xt ) suggests a bigger step to take than −∇f1(xt ) at point xt . To explicitly incorporate angular distance into the optimization procedure , we use the cosine distance between the current point xt ∈Sp−1 and the Euclidean gradient descent direction −∇f(xt ) , i.e. , \u0010 1 + x⊤ t ∇f(xt ) ∥∇f(xt)∥ \u0011 , as a multiplier to the computed Riemannian gradient according to Equation ( 5 ) . The rationale of this design is to encourage parameters with greater cosine distance from its target"

    "text": "Euclidean gradient descent direction −∇f(xt ) , i.e. , \u0010 1 + x⊤ t ∇f(xt ) ∥∇f(xt)∥ \u0011 , as a multiplier to the computed Riemannian gradient according to Equation ( 5 ) . The rationale of this design is to encourage parameters with greater cosine distance from its target direction to take a larger update step . We ﬁnd that when updating negative samples , it is empirically better to use negative cosine similarity instead of cosine distance as the multiplier to the Riemannian gradient . This is probably because negative samples are randomly sampled from the vocabulary and most of them are semantically irrelevant with the center word . Therefore , their ideal embeddings should be orthogonal to the center word ’s embedding . However , using cosine distance will encourage them to point to the opposite direction of the center word ’s embedding . In summary , with the above designs , we optimize the parameters by the following update rule : xt+1 = Rxt \u0012 −ηt \u0012 1 + x⊤ t ∇f(xt ) ∥∇f(xt)∥ \u0013 \u0000I −xtx⊤ t \u0001 ∇f(xt ) \u0013 . ( 7 ) \n Finally , we provide the convergence guarantee of the above update rule when applied to optimize our objectives . Theorem 2 . When the update rule given by Equation ( 7 ) is applied to L(x ) , and the learning rate satisﬁes the usual condition in stochastic approximation , i.e. , P t η2 t < ∞and P t ηt = ∞ , x converges almost surely to a critical point x∗and grad L(x ) converges almost surely to 0 , i.e. , Pr \u0010 lim t→∞L(xt ) = L(x∗ ) \u0011 = 1 , Pr \u0010 lim t→∞grad L(xt ) = 0 \u0011 = 1 . The proof of Theorem 2 can be found in Appendix B. Evaluation In this section , we empirically evaluate the quality of spherical text embeddings for three common text embedding application tasks , i.e. , word similarity , document clustering and document classiﬁcation . Our model is named JoSE , for Joint Spherical Embedding . For all three tasks , our spherical embeddings and all baselines are trained according to the following setting : The models are trained for 10 iterations on the corpus ; the local context window size is 10 ; the embedding dimension is 100 . In our JoSE model , we set the margin in Equation ( 3 ) to be 0.15 , the number of negative samples to be 2 , the initial learning rate to be 0.04 with linear decay . Other hyperparameters are set to be the default value of the corresponding algorithm . Also , since text embeddings serve as the building block for many downstream tasks , it is essential that the embedding training is efﬁcient and can scale to very large datasets . At the end of this section , we will provide the training time of different word embedding models"

The training corpus for word similarity is the latest Wikipedia dump4 containing 2.4 billion tokens . Words appearing less than 100 times are discarded , leaving 239 , 672 unique tokens .

The results demonstrate that training embeddings in the spherical space is essential for the superior performance on word similarity . We attempt to explain why the recent popular language model , BERT [ 10 ] , falls behind other baselines on this task : ( 1 ) BERT learns contextualized representations , but word similarity evaluation is conducted in a context - free manner ; averaging contextualized representations to derive context - free representations may not be the intended usage of BERT .

E - mail : hao.peng@utsouthwestern.edu , steve.jiang@utsouthwestern.edu \n Abstract Achieving effective synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy is critical for optimizing tumor control and treatment outcomes . To explore the underlying mechanisms of this synergy , we have investigated a novel treatment approach known as personalized ultra - fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiation therapy ( PULSAR ) , which emphasizes the impact of radiation timing on treatment efficacy . However , the precise mechanism remains unclear . Building on insights from small animal PULSAR studies , we developed a mathematical framework consisting of multiple ordinary differential equations to elucidate the temporal dynamics of tumor control resulting from radiation and the adaptive immune response . The model accounts for the migration and infiltration of T - cells within the tumor microenvironment . This proposed model establishes a causal and quantitative link between radiation therapy and immunotherapy , providing a valuable in - silico analysis tool for designing future PULSAR trials . Keywords : Immunotherapy ; Personalized ultra - fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiation therapy ( PULSAR ) ; T - cell migration ; T - cell infiltration ; Mathematical modeling . \n 1 . Introduction The integration of radiation therapy and immunotherapy has emerged as a pivotal approach in the realm of tumor management , leading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced quality of life . This convergence of advances in both physics and biology has given rise to the burgeoning field of radio - immunotherapy , with numerous ongoing trials [ 1]–[3 ] . However , these scientific strides have also ushered in a host of new and significant questions . These include inquiries about the optimal radiation dosing scheme for stimulating an immune response , the timing of immunotherapy administration in relation to radiation , and the integration of radiation therapy into the era of personalized precision medicine . A novel paradigm known as personalized ultra - fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiation therapy ( PULSAR ) , involves the delivery of radiation in ablative doses , with intervals spanning weeks or months , in contrast to the daily fractions commonly employed in clinical practice .

This extended time between radiation doses enables adaptation to changes within the tumor , allowing for potential synergetic interaction with immunotherapies . Preliminary preclinical investigations into PULSAR in tandem with immunotherapy have already underscored the impact of radiation scheduling on therapeutic efficacy . Notably , these studies revealed significant benefits when radiation was administered either as a single fraction or separated by ten days , whereas no similar benefit was observed for radiation pulses separated by just one day [ 4 ] . Although numerous prior studies have delved into the potential impact of radiation timing in standalone radiotherapy such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) , similar research in the realm of radioimmunotherapy remains relatively scarce . It is indeed a challenging task that involves many complex biological processes . To name a few , irradiated T - cells assume a critical role in controlling tumor growth post - radiation therapy . The tumor microenvironment may offer protection to irradiated T - cells , which would otherwise undergo rapid demise elsewhere in the body [ 5 ] . Moreover , radiation may also exert immune - inhibitory effects , a factor that must be carefully considered when pairing it with immunotherapy . Our primary focus is to develop a mathematical model that can model the observed PULSAR effect in the experimental outcomes . The PULSAR effect encompasses not only improved tumor control with radiation pulses separated by one day , compared to a ten - day interval , in the absence of immunotherapy but also a reversed outcome in the presence of immunotherapy . Several representative studies on modeling tumor growth and control are briefly presented below . A top - down model was constructed to depict tumor growth while synchronizing radiotherapy and inhibitors of the PD1 - PDL1 axis and the CTLA4 pathway [ 6 ] . This model was later simplified and adapted to explore the effects of single- and multiple - fraction schemes with 1 - methyl tryptophan [ 7 ] . In another study , immune response during and after radiotherapy was modeled to analyze the growth of tumors in immune limited and immune escape modes [ 8 ] . Another mathematical model was built to simulate and predict the response of non - small cell lung cancer patients \n to combined chemo- and radiotherapy using overall survival data from clinical trials [ 9 ] . Kosinsky et al . [ 10 ] developed a quantitative pharmacologic model that illustrates the cancer immunity cycle , incorporating radiation treatment and therapeutic blockade of PD1 or PDL18 . While comprehensive , this model requires a large number of parameters , potentially leading to overfitting issues .

Such an approach was also applied to capture tumor dynamics and predict median clinical responses to monotherapy , combination , and sequential therapy involving the blockade of inhibitory effects by CTLA4 , PD1 , and PDL1 [ 11 ] . Another bottom - up computational model was used to investigate tumor response solely to anti - PD1 antibodies , employing a minimal number of four parameters [ 12 ] . Additionally , Sung et al . published a quantitative model outlining the immunosuppressive and immune - stimulating effects induced by radiation therapy [ 13 ] . However , this model focused on simulating fractionation strategies without considering any specific immunotherapy modalities . Despite these promising results , the optimal scheduling of fractionation in the presence of immunotherapy remains a relatively unexplored territory , particularly in the context of PULSAR . It is thus imperative to unravel the intricate processes underlying PULSAR and optimize its synergy with immunotherapy accordingly . In this study , we developed a discrete - time mathematical framework and validated its performances based on the experimental results of mouse studies , taking into account the migration and infiltration of T cells as a function of both dose and time . 2 . Methods 2.1 Small animal experiments All animal procedures were performed following the animal experimental guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center . Female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River or Jackson Laboratories at six to eight weeks old . Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) was derived from lung cancer of the C57BL/6 line . Tumor cells were injected subcutaneously on the right leg of mice . Mice were administered ( i.p ) α - PD - L1 ( 200 ug ) or anti - CD8 agent ( 200 ug ) with different schedules for each group ( see Figure A1 ) . Tumor - bearing mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and irradiated with 10 to 40 Gy according to different schedules . Local irradiations were conducted on a dedicated x - ray irradiator ( X - RAD 32 , Precision X - ray , Inc. ) . Various collimator sizes were developed to form the field of view , depending on tumor size . The mouse was positioned such that the source - to - tumor surface distance was 20 cm and the tumor was in the center of the x - ray beam . The energy of the x - ray was set to 250 kVp and the current was set to 15 mA for irradiation . The dose rate under this condition was 19.468 Gy / min , which was calibrated using a PTW 31010 ionization chamber and a PTW UnidosEelectrometer ( PTW North America Corporation , New York , NY ) following the AAPM TG-61 protocol"

The dose rate under this condition was 19.468 Gy / min , which was calibrated using a PTW 31010 ionization chamber and a PTW UnidosEelectrometer ( PTW North America Corporation , New York , NY ) following the AAPM TG-61 protocol . \n The mice were randomized to treatment groups when tumors reached 150 to 200 mm3 . Generally , the initial dose of α - PD - L1 or isotype control was applied two or three days before the first radiation , on the day of the initial radiation , and then subsequently every other day for a period . The tumor volumes were measured by length ( x ) , width ( y ) , and height ( z ) and calculated as tumor volume = xyz/2 . When the tumor volume was over 1500 mm3 , or the mouse had significant ulceration in the tumor , the mouse reached the survival endpoint and was euthanized . The censored data were then treated with an imputation method [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , followed by the computation of the mean of each treatment group . The data were then partitioned into training and testing datasets , each containing twelve distinct treatment groups . The training data were used to estimate the model parameters while the testing data were held aside for model validation . 2.2 Model overview Our framework includes the dynamics of three populations , including two types of T - cells and tumor cells as exemplified in Figure 1 . First , through a chain reaction of other biological pathways such as STING , radiation therapy ( RT ) recruits new T - cells to the tumor site and stimulates their filtration , in addition to killing T cells along with tumor cells . Second , tumor growth is regulated by the immune response orchestrated by effector T cells , which can be either enhanced by the checkpoint inhibitor antibody ( anti- PD - L1 ) or suppressed by a monoclonal antibody ( anti - CD8 ) . More details are described in Equations ( 1)- ( 6 ) . \n stimulatory ( blue arrows ) effects . - The tumor growth dynamics follow Equation ( 1 ) , where Tn is the tumor volume on day n and grows exponentially to Tn+1 at a rate 𝜇 when no other interference is present .

In other words , the elapsed time matters and a “ memorizing ” mechanism occurs . The original linear - quadratic term is multiplied by an additional factor due to increased radio - sensitivity post - irradiation . 𝑅 ! in Equation ( 3 ) , with an initial value of 0 i.e. , 𝑅. = 0 on day 0 , along with a coefficient 𝛾 indicates the accumulated effect due to a fraction administered on day n , which decays daily by a factor of 𝜏. Accordingly , the subsequent effect , 𝑅 ! \" # , is determined jointly by two elements . One is proportional to the strength of the prior radiation ( 1 −𝑆 ! ) , and the other is the value of formerly accrued effect 𝜏𝑅 ! .

The reason why chose an instantaneous is that we consider only immediate effects that begin rapidly after radiation therapy ( e.g. , within hours rather than days ) . The generation of T cells as a result of radiation therapy is a complex process that can vary widely depending on several factors . Some tumors may be more immunogenic , leading to a stronger T cell response after radiation . Alternatively , a higher dose may stimulate the release of more tumor - associated antigens and lead to the recruitment of more T cell response .

Simulated annealing [ 16 ] was applied to optimize parameters using the group means of the training data and mean square error ( MSE ) as a loss function .

The free parameters , along with the initial tumor size 𝑇. , were initialized as summarized in Table 1Error ! Reference source not found ..

First , we fitted the tumor growth rate μ within the 0Gy group without anti - PD - L1 and T0 . Second , with μ fixed from the previous stage , α , β , τ , and γ , along with group - wise T0 , were calculated from regimens involving only RTs , such as the groups 10Gyd0d1 , 10Gyd0d10 , 10Gyd0d1d10d11 , 10Gyd0d20 , and 10Gyd0d1d20d21 . In the final optimization step , we used the above estimates of α , β , τ , and γ as initial values . In this step , group - wise T0 and all parameters , except the fixed μ , were assessed using all available data except for the 0Gy group . 3 ) Simultaneously estimating all parameters by fitting all treatment groups . It is important to highlight that we discovered that the simultaneous estimation of all parameters using the complete dataset yielded superior results when compared to two alternative methods . Therefore , only the results of the simultaneous estimation are presented in this manuscript . 3 . Results 3.1 Experimental results and PULSAR effect To demonstrate the PULSAR effect , we will summarize key findings from the animal studies . In this context , we will emphasize the prominent trend in Figures 2 and 3 , while presenting specific quantitative results alongside the simulation outcomes in section 3.2 . ( 20Gyd0 , 10Gyd0d1 , 10Gyd0d10 , and 10Gyd0d4 ): All these treatment regimens received an identical radiation dose . Those administered with radiation at closer time intervals had slightly different responses to anti - PD - L1 . An intriguing observation is the divergence between the solid and dashed blue lines in \n 20Gyd0 ( receiving the lowest anti - PD - L1 ) , 10Gyd0d10 , but not in the case of 10Gyd0d4 or 10Gyd0d1 . This suggests the presence of immunologically significant processes occurring between days 1 and 10 , which can be disrupted by a 10Gy dose and subsequently diminish the cumulative effectiveness of anti - PD- L1 . ( 20Gyd0d10 , 15Gyd0d10 ): An additional advantage of immunotherapy is apparent when a higher radiotherapy dose is administered at a 10 - day interval . The two curves exhibit a striking similarity , while the 15Gyd0d10 group shows relatively inferior tumor control . This extended timeframe allows for enhanced immune cascades and the arrival of different types of cells to signal and bolster the overall anti - tumor immune response . ( 10Gyd0d10 and 10Gyd0d1d10d11 ): The increased radiotherapy dose should typically result in better tumor control . In the 10Gyd0d1d10d11 group , the tumor still has a 10 - day interval between radiation treatments but receives a higher cumulative radiation dose , always followed by a second dose the day after the first .

    "text": "tumor control . In the 10Gyd0d1d10d11 group , the tumor still has a 10 - day interval between radiation treatments but receives a higher cumulative radiation dose , always followed by a second dose the day after the first . However , the difference between the solid blue and dashed blue line is less in the 10Gyd0d1d10d1 group , relative to the 10Gyd0d10 group . In our view , this is likely due to the fact that some immune cells were infiltrating the tumor in the first 24 hours after radiation and may be killed by the second dose when given on d1 . ( 10Gyd0d10 and 10Gyd0d20 ): The PULSAR effect is evident in the former scenario but not in the latter . In the 10Gyd0d20 group , there is a less pronounced benefit from additional PD - L1 when the administration is delayed for 20 days . This is likely because the tumors are growing rapidly and require an additional radiation dose primarily to control tumor growth . A single 10Gy dose , in combination with immunotherapy alone , may not suffice . It seems there 's a fine balance between achieving a state of equilibrium that allows synergy to manifest and enabling radiotherapy to take a more proactive role in controlling tumor growth . ( 10Gyd0d1d10d11 , 10Gyd0d1d20d21 , 40Gyd0 ): All three regimens deliver the same cumulative radiation dose . The most effective tumor control is observed in the 40Gyd0 group , where radiotherapy is administered all at once . Setting aside toxicity and side effects , the PULSAR effect is observed except in the 10Gyd0d1d20d21 group . This implies either that the immune response to a single higher dose is superior to lower doses or that the subsequent 3x10Gy treatments worsen the outcome . Below are two additional observations to note . First , in all the figures , the clear separation between the solid blue and dashed blue lines does n't occur until around day 10 , which coincides with the delivery of the second radiotherapy dose . This delay in response is expected in LLC , a tumor that is inherently resistant to immunotherapy . This highlights the role of radiotherapy in altering the tumor immune microenvironment and triggering cascades of immune responses . The 10 - day lag suggests the involvement of lymph nodes , as the priming of a new immune response through a lymph node typically takes around 7 - 10 days . Furthermore , the difference between 15Gyd0d10 and 15Gyd0d10 - CD8 serves as confirmation of the \n participation of CD8 + T cells in the anti - tumor immune response , thereby validating the utility of our model based on T cell dynamics . 3.2 Modeling results The procedure of simultaneously estimating all parameters using the entire dataset produces the best performance , achieving a root mean squared error ( RMSE ) of 320 mm3 in the training data .

Overall , a good alignment of fitted results to experiment data is observed . It is important to note that , in the current phase , our primary focus is on replicating the observed PULSAR effect in the experimental data rather than placing a strong emphasis on quantitative aspects . ( 10Gyd0d1 , 10Gyd0d10 , 10Gyd0d20 ): When comparing the solid blue and red lines , there is a consistency between experimental and model - based tumor growth . The measured tumor volumes on day 15 are 497 mm3 ( the 10Gyd0d1 group ) , 1100 mm3 ( the 10Gyd0d10 group ) , and 1514 mm3 ( the 10Gyd0d20 group ) , while their respective simulated counterparts are 276 mm3 , 728 mm3 , and 1615 mm3 . More importantly , the modeling results underscore the most prominent efficacy of anti - PD - L1 when there 's a ten- day gap between the two radiation fractions . In cases where the fraction interval of the split course is either just one day or as long as 20 days , the benefit from anti - PD - L1 is minimal . For the 10Gyd0d10 with anti- PD - L1 group , the simulated tumor volume on day 18 is 257 mm3 , significantly lower than the 1392 mm3 without anti - PD - L1 . Conversely , the modeling outcomes 280 mm3 ( the 10Gyd0d1 with anti - PD - L1 group ) and 1023 mm3 ( the 10Gyd0d20 with anti - PD - L1 group ) on day 15 are quite similar to those without anti- PDL1 , 276 mm3 ( the 10Gyd0d1 group ) and 1615 mm3 ( the 10Gyd0d20 group ) . ( 10Gyd0d1d10d11,10Gyd0d1d20d21 ): The estimated tumor volumes generally align with the actual ones . On day 23 , the observed and estimated tumor volumes are 703 mm3 and 718 mm3 for the 0Gyd0d1d10d11 group and 1506 mm3 and 1508 mm3 for the 0Gyd0d1d20d21 group . Furthermore , the model predicts a tumor volume of 460 mm3 in the 10Gyd0d1d10d11 with anti - PD - L1 group , showcasing the PULSAR effect . The model also demonstrates strong accuracy in the testing groups , with an RMSE of 287 mm3 . The same patterns as described earlier are observed in groups with varying time intervals . ( 10Gyd0d4 , 15Gyd0d10 , 15Gyd0d10 - CD8 , 20Gyd0 ): The modeling curves approximate the measurement curves well in these groups . The tumor volumes are 1011 mm3 ( the 10Gyd0d4 group ) , 1294 mm3 ( the 15Gyd0d10 group ) , 969 mm3 ( the 15Gyd0d10 - CD8 group ) , and 1009 mm3 ( the 20Gyd0 group ) on day 22 .

Due to the short interval of four days in the 10Gyd0d4 group , the impact of anti - PD - L1 on inhibiting tumor growth is exceedingly modest , as evidenced by both a measurement of 1125 mm3 and a simulated volume of 1109 mm3 on day 22 . In the case of the 15Gyd0d10 group , the simulation reveals a noteworthy contrast \n in tumor volumes with anti - PD - L1 ( 210 mm3 ) and without anti - PD - L1 ( 1104 mm3 ) on day 22 , with a difference of 894 mm3 . A comparable disparity of 599 mm3 is indeed observed in the experimental data . In the experiment data , the 15Gyd0d10 - CD8 group with anti - PD - L1 ( 1282 mm3 ) differs from that without anti - PD - L1 ( 969 mm3 ) in tumor volume on day 22 by 313 mm3 , which is estimated to be a difference of 17 mm3 ( 913 mm3 versus 930 mm3 ) . The modeling result appears to differ from the actual value in this radiation regime with the presence of anti - PD - L1 . This discrepancy arises from the model ’s challenge in accurately predicting increased tumor volume control penalty when the anti - PD - L1 is present , as compared to when it is not . However , our model showcases that the depletion of T cells , as a result of anti - CD8 administration , also accelerates tumor growth , even when fractions are properly spaced , in the presence of a checkpoint inhibitor . ( 20Gyd0d10 , 40Gyd0 ): On day 22 , the simulated differences in tumor volume are 134 mm3 ( 92 mm3 for 20Gyd0d10 with anti - PD - L1 versus 226 mm3 for 20Gyd0d10 without anti - PD - L1 ) and 113 mm3 ( 75 mm3 for 40Gyd0 with anti - PD - L1 versus 188 mm3 for 40Gyd0 without anti - PD - L1 ) . This approximation closely mirrors the observed differences of 298 mm3 and 126 mm3 in the experimental data . Nonetheless , we also observe disparities between experimental outcomes and simulation results in these two scenarios . For instance , noticeable differences between the solid blue and red lines are evident between day -2 and 16 for 40Gyd0 and 20Gyd0d10 .

This framework reveals its potential value for elucidating the temporal dynamics of tumor control , and the impact of both radiation and adaptive immune response , in a qualitative or at most semi - quantitative way . Our framework establishes a causal link between radiation therapy and immunotherapy . The framework can effectively model the tumor progression in the presence of monotherapy or an integrated treatment approach as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , for various groups with distinct time intervals of one day , four days , ten days , and twenty days . Additionally , the model can support in - silico studies and generate essential data to address additional research questions related to combined therapy . The strength of using ODEs for modeling the synergy is demonstrated , with respect to its practical use and generalization capability . The ODEs may appear unsophisticated and overly simplified . However , it is the most basic ODE models that have been most commonly used for practical biological modeling , such as tumor growth models , pharmacodynamics models , and the well - known linear quadratic ( LQ ) model in radiobiology . Mathematical simplicity is purposely attained with minimal components and parameters . Also , we believe the chosen top - down approach is easier for potential translation into clinical practice . Some parameters , such as 𝜏 , 𝜙 # , 𝜙/ , 𝜆 , can be validated and fine - tuned through experiments including flow cytometry and molecular imaging technologies . For example , optical imaging tools can be employed to investigate the dynamics of T cells , comprising their migration from lymph nodes to the targeted tumor via the circulatory system and their subsequent infiltration into the tumor . In our modeling , the “ increased radio - sensitivity ” is found to be an essential component for the ODEs to achieve high fitting accuracy , through the heuristic terms defined in Eqs . 2 and 3 . The original linear- quadratic term is multiplied by the additional terms due to increased radio - sensitivity post - irradiation , depending on two parameters 𝛾 and 𝜏 in a recursive manner .

As shown in Figure 3 , tumor control is more noticeable in group 10Gyd0d1 without anti - PDL1 ( two 10 Gy pulses , day 0 and day 1 ) , compared to group10Gyd0d10 without anti - PDL1 ( two 10 Gy pulses , day 0 and day 10 ) . Nevertheless , two additional questions remain to be answered . First , is there any underlying radiobiological cause possibly linked to the increased radiosensitivity ? Second , whether the exponential decay of the cumulative effect of a single pulse linked to cell repair ? \n Another novel aspect of our study is the integration of T cell dynamics along with pulsed radiation , including the differentiation and conversion of preexisting intratumoral and newly infiltrating T - cells . Multiple investigations have underscored the critical role played by the density and characteristics of tumor- infiltrating T cells in determining the clinical effectiveness of anti - PD-1 / PD - L1 therapy . Arina et al . [ 5 ] reported that resident T cells present during radiation are more resistant to death and are important for overall tumor control . However , T cells in other compartments of the body are less resistant to radiation . Although the authors did not perform a second dose of radiation 24 hours after the first , we find it an intriguing point for studying the synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy . We speculate that newly infiltrated T cells might be more sensitive to the second radiation pulse as they are phenotypically more like the T cells in other areas of the body . This leads to the formulation in Eq . 5 . Without taking into account the immunomodulatory effect , the parameter 𝜏 results in reduced tumor control for a larger spacing between two pulses ( i.e. , smaller tumor volume corresponding to 1 - day spacing ) . However , such a pattern is altered after considering the temporal dynamic of T - cells . When the two pulses are spaced ten days apart , the PULSAR effect is observed to be most significant relative to other spacing schemes ( 1 day , 4 days , 20 days ) . At the same time , the estimated parameters 𝜙 # , 𝜙/ , 𝜆 support our speculation the T - cell reprogramming is closely tied to the PULSAR effect . Different values of 𝜙 # and 𝜙/ reveal two types of T- cells of different radiosensitivity . A subpopulation of T - cells gradually develops resistance and is converted into intratumoral T - cells , as represented by the parameter𝜆. Although we do not expect the proposed model to be quantitative , the examination of these parameters increases our confidence in the soundness of the ODE - based modeling approach ."

Although we do not expect the proposed model to be quantitative , the examination of these parameters increases our confidence in the soundness of the ODE - based modeling approach . Two plausible biological processes that might explain the maximum PULSAR effect around 10 days are briefly mentioned below . One process is related to Treg . To prevent autoimmune reactions following radiation , Treg cells are recruited to the tumor site and suppress immune response through a number of signaling pathways , such as elevated expression of CTLA4 for suppressing inflammation response of antigen - presenting cells , cytokines IL10 for T helper cells , and TGF - β for cytotoxic T cells . Simultaneously , some Treg cells infiltrate the tumor bed and release type - I interferon gamma , which leads to the upregulation of PD - L1 on the surface of tumor cells . The temporal scale of this last process takes up to several days after radiation . Another process might be related to the homing of T cells . In \" hot \" tumors , there is a robust immune response characterized by significant immune cell infiltration and activation of immune pathways . Conversely , \" cold \" tumors such as LLC in our study exhibit limited immune response , with minimal immune cell infiltration and reduced immune activity . In \" hot \" tumor models , a single radiation dose may be sufficient for maximizing synergy with immunotherapy , as initial priming of the immune response has already occurred due to preexisting tumor immunity . In “ cold ” tumors , an initial priming dose of radiation is necessary , and thus the PULSAR effect manifests after approximately 10 days . \n Our current study presents several limitations which will be addressed in future studies . Firstly , the model development was based on a limited dataset . The small sample size of five to ten subjects in each treatment group indicates a need for recruiting more mice in subsequent studies , to reduce both intra- and inter - group variation . Secondly , in our current study , the definition of synergy relies solely on tumor size , lacking additional information about T cells related to migration and infiltration . A potential remedy involves conducting flow cytometry and optical imaging experiments to better understand the temporal behavior of T cells . Thirdly , our model focuses on the PULSAR effect , not yet taking into account the risk of potential toxicities . As the combined radioimmunotherapy has the potential to result in delayed toxicities , the standard assessment models may not be appropriately suited . 5 . Conclusion The synergistic potential of combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy has a unique role in cancer treatment . In this work , a mathematical model based on multiple ODEs is developed to examine the PULSAR effect ,"
